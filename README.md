# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project
This project has been submitted by Joep Maas as part of the Front-End Development Nanodegree. The starting HTML, CSS and JS files (resources and game engine) and image files were given. The goal of the project was to finalize the code by adding the game logic in app.js, using object-oriented programming.
